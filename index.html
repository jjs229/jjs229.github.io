              <h3>Projects</h3>

              <h5>BSPD</h5>
              <p>details</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile rounded mx-auto mb-2" src="img/BSPD.png" alt="" style="width: 400px">
              <h5>Electronic Brake Bias</h5>
              <p>Taking over the Ergonomics subteam as the technical director, I noticed that our team, like all other FSAE teams, could not properly add a brake bias knob as the pedal box area is too tight and it leads to many malfunctions. This led me to the idea of an electronic brake bias. I worked with two new members on hardware and software, guiding them and teaching them how to spec the motor and potentiometer, alongside with how to set up a basic control loop inside of Motec software. This project was simple, but comprised of a DC motor with an amazing torque and a potentiometer to decipher brake bias at all times. This system worked really well and was a large reason to our first place Cummins innovation trophy.</p>
              <h5>System Design and Custom Wire Harness</h5>
              <p>The hardest thing of this project was system integration as it spanned across seven other subteams which I was not very knowledgable about. I used motorsport grade manufacturing methods that accounted for excess EMI and noise. The ECU has extreme capabilities, but all sensor inputs needed to be configured with correct failure modes before calibration and new hardware needed to be match with system specifications. A power budget was calculated which prompted a battery change. Digital signal protocols had to be considered with a large expansion to CAN. </p>

              <h5>Custom CAN Steering Wheel</h5>
              <p>In an engineering competition, data is key for bettery design and our ECU started running out of ports. In combattance, I created a custom CAN board and used our steering wheel as a test piece. The steering wheel was already restricted as the lifeline connectors presented problems with a maximum amount of wires. The steering wheel only has very basic functions so it servered as an amazing starting point. It was also had the capability to be hard wired back to an original condition if there was any board malfunction.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile rounded mx-auto mb-2" src="img/SW.png" alt="" style="width: 400px">
              <h5>EV System Design</h5>
              <p>The competition and the automotive industry is moving in the EV direction and it is an amazing place for innovation to take place. That being said, our club is transitioning to EV. Being the eldest electrical engineer with systems design background I was also in charge of the system design of the powertrain. I built a team alongside a few other members where we research as much as possible and began designing the best powertrain we could. As of now, parts are integrating extremely well through software and hardware. Our test bench is only complete as we await for a few more parts from manufacturers, but this has been an amazing and exciting challenge. We have created may pinouts, harnesses, and PCBAs to construc a cohesive system and time will only tell how well it stand up to motorsports.</p>
              <h5 class="mb-0">Custom Accumulator Management System (ACTIVE)</h5>
              <p>Although not necessary for our first year of EV. It is a porject I was eager to get a head start on. As I try to relinquish as much responsibility to the next generation of Pitt FSAE I am still trying to push our innovation space. I've been working on this custom AMS with Tesla sponsered chips for two months now and am confident a working design will be ready soon. I'll keep this updated so check back later soon to see the progress I have made.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-0">TI-RLSK Autonomous Race Robot</h5>
              <p>I created the rover as part of my Cyber-Physical Systems Design Class. The hardware was provided by Texas Instruments and I provided the code. The robot was programmed in C with capabilities of MQTT communcations, wifi communications, bluetooth communications, infared distance sensors, infared line detection, and bump sensors coded using a combination of hardware and sysTick timers. The robot was able to complete the course dodging obstacles and other robots around the engineering hall 12th floor.</p>

              <h5 class="mb-0">Naval Nuclear Labs Current Sensor Interface</h5>
              <p>As a project for NNL our goal was to create a 4-20mA detector interface. This included bluetooth communcation, 4 sensor inputs, and a screen for the user. Two PCBAs were created for the project, but the challenge was choosing MILSPEC parts with correct design justification down to the resistor. Military level documentation design, testing, and user manual documentation was created for the the entire system. I also learned the edge of design of an ATMEGA chip and its capabilities which is a common problem in transitioning from basic to advance products.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile rounded mx-auto mb-2" src="img/NNL_Enclosure.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px">
              <h5 class="mb-0">Kensington E-Lock</h5>
              <p>This project was done for a class in conjunction with the Kensington Lock company to combat it expiring patents. The goal was to electrify old technology. In this project I learned how to make extremely small PCBAs and all of the manufacturing problems that arise with it. It was a simple system that comprised of a bluetooth capable microcontroller and an accelerometer. The most advantageuous goal of the project was to achieve the longest battery life possible. With a small coin cell battery I was able to verify a three year battery life for the product.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile rounded mx-auto mb-2" src="img/fingypic.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px">
              <h5 class="mb-0">XProjects Autonomous Drone</h5>
              <p>Sponsored by research faculty, this project was made to create a base model autonomous drone using neuromorphic methodologies to then convert to a platform using a Loihi chip. I redesigned mechanical hardware which caused a previous group to significantly struggle. I then redesign all of the controls to an extremely responsive state for directions of travel using PID controls across four propellers.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid img-profile rounded mx-auto mb-2" src="img/drone.jpg" alt="" style="width: 400px">
              <h5 class="mb-0">Custom Home Hub</h5>
              <p>Serving as my final junior design project, I wanted more experience in internet systems and coding. Using a school server I found in E-waste, I created a hub to host automation bots, a security hub, and a remote desktop. The first automation bot I built was a "Jake Shake Bot" that scanned NHL stats API's every night then if Jake Guentzel scored, it outputted a message on Slack via a Slack API that a discount was available for milkshakes that day. I also created a security camera as part of this project. This comprised of a raspberry pi, a standard camera capable of infared, and a wifi usb stick. It used a simple motion detection code, recorded the video, then uploaded the video to the server.</p>

          <p>Engineering is not only a major passion of mine, but I am also deeply drawn to the world of travel and exploring diverse cultures. Witnessing the rich tapestry of different societies around the globe serves as a profound inspiration for two additional hobbies that bring me immense joy: cooking and philosophy. I find that these pursuits are intricately intertwined with my love for discovering new cultures. Moreover, while engineering occupies a central role in my life, I firmly believe in leading an active and dynamic lifestyle. Engaging in various physical pursuits, such as the intense disciplines of Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, brings me great fulfillment. These martial arts not only challenge me physically but also foster discipline and resilience. Additionally, I have a cherished pastime that holds a special place in my heart: playing ice hockey. There is a unique thrill and camaraderie that comes with gliding across the ice and competing in the spirited game of hockey, particularly during the winter season when the opportunity arises for delightful pond hockey matches. If you have any intriguing recipes or captivating books to recommend, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at your convenience.</p>
